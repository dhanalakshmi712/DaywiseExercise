Problem Statement:
Find out whether the following file will compile. If it does not compile, how you would fix it?
 
                                                          class Loop {
                  int x = 5;
                             while (x  > 1) {
                                   x = x - 1;
                        if (x < 3) {
                              System.out.println(“small x”);
                        }
                   }
             }
Ans:The program will compile.The output is “small 2”
